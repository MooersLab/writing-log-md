# writing-log-md: Writing log template in markdown

## Introduction
Use this writing log in parallel to the main writing project document to track your progress and record your plans.
This template can be used in any text editor that supports Markdown.
[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is a simple markup language.
The files are usually rendered to either PDF or HTML.
The resulting files are very attractive.
This `README.md` file is written in the GitHub flavor of markdown.

Compatiable text editors include Visual Studio Code, Vim, NeoVim, Emacs, TextMate, Sublime Text, and so on.

The writing log is a document that is external to the manuscript.
It is used to store the plans and progress made on a one manuscript.

It is also tool that ease re-engagement in an interrupted writing project.
It is like a master thinking document or second brain for a writing project.

- [Writing log template in Org-mode](https://github.com/MooersLab/writingLogTemplateInOrg) Has all of the features of the LaTeX variant. Favored by many Emacs users. Org-mode is a powerful analog of markdown that can interpret LaTeX code blocks. It is vastly more capable than markdown. It even supports literate programming.
